# Bluetooth Sensor Scanner

This package provides a utility script for scanning Bluetooth devices and logging their information, with automatic systemd timer integration.

## Usage

### Manual Execution
Run the scanner manually:
```bash
ws-bluetooth-devices
```

### Automatic Execution (Default)
After installation, the scanner automatically runs every minute via systemd timer.

## Systemd Integration

The package includes systemd service and timer files for automatic operation:

- **Service**: `ws-bluetooth-scanner.service`
- **Timer**: `ws-bluetooth-scanner.timer` (runs every minute)

### Managing the Timer

Check timer status:
```bash
sudo systemctl status ws-bluetooth-scanner.timer
sudo systemctl list-timers ws-bluetooth-scanner.timer
```

Stop the timer:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop ws-bluetooth-scanner.timer
```

Start the timer:
```bash
sudo systemctl start ws-bluetooth-scanner.timer
```

Disable automatic startup:
```bash
sudo systemctl disable ws-bluetooth-scanner.timer
```

View recent scan logs:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u ws-bluetooth-scanner.service -f
```

## What the Script Does

The script will:
1. Create the log directory `/var/ws/bluetooth/` if it doesn't exist
2. Generate a log file named with the hostname and current timestamp
3. Capture Bluetooth Low Energy advertising packets using tshark
4. Perform a Bluetooth LE scan using hcitool
5. Both commands timeout after 30 seconds

## Requirements

- tshark (from wireshark package)
- bluez (Bluetooth utilities)
- systemd
- Bluetooth adapter with monitoring capabilities

## Output

The script creates log files in `/var/ws/bluetooth/` containing:
- Bluetooth device MAC addresses
- RSSI values
- Device names (when available)

Log files are named: `/var/ws/bluetooth/<hostname>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.log`

## Notes

- Root privileges are required for Bluetooth monitoring operations
- The systemd service runs as root automatically
- Log files accumulate over time; consider setting up log rotation
